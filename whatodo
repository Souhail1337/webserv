    select:

    `select waits for events that are typically outside your program's control. In essence, by calling select, your program says "I have nothing to do until ..., please suspend my process".
`
    `For example, if you are downloading something, your loop would have to wait on new data to arrive, a timeout to occur if the transfer is stuck, or the user to interrupt, which is precisely what select does.\
    `When you have multiple downloads, data arriving on any of the connections triggers activity in your program (you need to write the data to disk), so you'd give a list of all download connections to select in the list of file descriptors to watch for "read".

    POLL:
        Polling is a technique for making requests in a non-blocking manner. It is particularly useful for applications that need to make requests to services which take a long time to process the request.

        Let's say we have a client and a server. If the client makes a synchronous request, its thread will block until the server responds. For a long process at the server, this can be problematic. In a real-world application accessed by lots of users, this would lead to reduced ability of the application to serve new requests.

        For e.g. if the capacity of the client is to hold 100 requests at a time and the server takes a few minutes to process a single request, this can lead to a situation where the client is unable to serve new requests because there are no free threads.
